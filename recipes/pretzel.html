        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A starwberry pretzel salad can be categorically defined as a retro dessert salad with a salty, crunchy pretzel crust,
            a creamy cheese filling and a sweet, fruity topping of strawberries and strawberry gelatin
        </p>
        <p>Here's a more detailed description:
            Base:
            The salad typically starts with a base of crushed pretzels, often combined with melted butter to create a flavorful and sturdy crust.
        </p>
        <p>
             Filling:
            A creamy layer of whipped cream cheese, often mixed with Cool Whip or sweetened condensed milk, provides a rich and tangy
             contrast to the salty crust.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Topping:
            The final layer features sliced strawberries, often encased in a strawberry-flavored gelatin.
